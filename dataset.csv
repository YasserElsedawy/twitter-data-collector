18,mermhart,Oh it’s boringly simple!!! But fun. Thanks. I got confused with the scores going on.,Please can you explain to us idiots (not me obviously) how this virtual / fantasy tennis thing works....,Ok this is the first response I saw for the #trainofkindness (see previous tweet) DM your sisters address. Tell her to build it and send me a video on here / via you and then she can send it to someone. We can follow the trains journey and feel more like we are in this together!,SUCH FUN IDEA - I’m going to post my Lego train to someone who replies who needs it if they can’t afford things to relax and distract. Once you have built it send me a video of where you are and why it helped and send or give it on. Let’s see where it ends up! #trainofkindness,Not at all no. It’s not up to me what the BBC put on air. I am surprised and as horrified as you they ever asked me in the first place! We all make our living in different ways. I am just a human like you. Love to you. Take care.,I continue to be astonished by the vitriol that still happens on twitter right now. I am ok with being misunderstood or not liked (it comes with the job) but that even at this time in our social history it’s happening I just find sad. Luckily love and kindness out lasts all. ,"We don’t get paid (and anything paid I am doing at the moment is going to charity). We get asked by the BBC if we would do the favour as they think it may help a sense of community spirit & kindness. That we ALL need right now. I hope u r ok, well & safe xxx",Never stop playing.

And touchtennis solves that so they can actually play. Please tell the players.,I just hope and pray that @MEActNetUK can help you connect with the support you need.
